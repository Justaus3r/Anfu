## Reporting a Vulnerability

Depends on the severity of vulnerability.if the issue is about performance,behaviour,etc then you can report it on [Anfu bug tracker](https://github.com/Justaus3r/Anfu/issues).but 
if the issue is related to encryption/decryption process that could potentionally lead to data being in danger then obviously you shouldn't report it here.report those issue to me at x-neron@pm.me.
